<body><font>This new dramatization of C.S. Lewis' classic, set in the land of Narnia,<br> 
faithfully recreates the magic and mystery of Aslan, the great lion, his struggle <br>
with the White Witch, and the  adventures of four children who inadvertently wander<br>
 from an old wardrobe intothe exciting, never-to-be-forgotten Narnia. The intense <br>
 action features chases, duels and escapes as the witch is determined to keep Narnia<br>
 in her possession and to end the reign of Aslan. All the memorable episodes from the<br>
 story are represented in this exciting dramatization: the temptation of Edmund by <br>
 the witch, the slaying of the evil wolf by Peter, the witnessing of Aslan's <br>
 resurrection by Susan and Lucy, the crowing of the four new rulers of Narnia,<br>
 and more. The supporting characters are also here: the unicorn, the centaur and<br>
 other forest animals, along with Father Christmas, Mr. and Mrs. Beaver and Tumnus<br>
 the Faun. This story of love, faith, courage and giving, with its triumph of good <br>
 over evil, is a true celebration of life. Easily staged, the play may be presented <br>
 without intermission or in two short acts if desired.</font></body>
