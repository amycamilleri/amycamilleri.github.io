<body>Harvey by Mary Chase who won a Pulitzer prize for this play in 1945. <br>
In Harvey, Elwood P. Dowd introduces his unseen friend Harvey (a six-foot,<br>
 three-and-one-half-inch tall pooka resembling a rabbit) to everyone he meets.<br>
 His sister, Veta, finds his eccentric behavior embarrassing. She decides to <br>
 have him committed. The doctors at the sanitarium propose to give Elwood an <br>
 injection that will make him into a "perfectly normal human being, and you know<br>
 what bastards they are!" (in the words of a taxi cab driver who has become <br>
 involved in the proceedings). In the end, will Veta realize that she would <br>
 rather have Elwood the same as he has always been â€” even if it means living <br>
 with Harvey?</body>
