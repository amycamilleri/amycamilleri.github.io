		<h3>Good Website</h3>	
<section>
	Northwest Edison's website is my favorite website to date; However, I will admit I most definetly have a bias. Northwest Edision is my dad's family business that I have been a part of 
	since I was 10 years old. This website is a refection of how the mondernized and innovated. The colors are cool instead of warm and they tend to lean toward
	the greens and purples kind of like the Northern Lights. I think using green is a very thoughtful choice not only because we are an environmentally concious
	company, but we are also headquartered in the Pacific Northwest (lots of trees). The navagation on this website is simple and clean and the overall look of it
	is very attractive.

<section>Looking at the code of this website it is using html and css it also says javascript but I have no idea what that is. The coding is very organized and 
extremely easy to follow. It is most definetly a well put together site, and you can tell it wasn't made by some college kid that took one web design class.

	I also have a bias towards the GOP website because I am a part of the GOP. But I also think that this website is really well laid out. The colors are red, white, and blue. Which obviously
	is very fitting. They have a great assortment of pictures, articles, and gifs. The setup is very clean and their header is super interesting and eye catching.

	The coding on this website was clean and clear. They used html,css, and javascript. A lot of the coding I didn't understand because I believe it is script.

		<h3>Bad Website</h3>
<section> At my job I work with a lot of Non-profits. Often-times they are very small and do not have the resources to have 
a beautifully made website. This is no reflection on them, but it is extremely interesting to look at their websites. Some of them look like something I 
would've made. For example, The Helena Express Singers, the third link on the top. The main page is very unflattering. It is functional which is important, but 
the actual website is very unattractive. The color choices they made are quite frankly... awful. There is pink, purple, and yellow type color. The background of 
the website is a grainey purple gray and their pictures look out of place. It seems as though no thought went into the actual asthetic of this website. 
<section>
Then if you take a look at the actual code it isn't that bad. They are using html and css format which is nice, and for the most part they've tried to keep
it organized. It is very basic though, it looks just like the template we made in class. This is a very rudimentary website, but I am thankful they have at least
something to represent their non-profit!
